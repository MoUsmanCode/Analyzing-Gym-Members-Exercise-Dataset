# Analyzing Gym Members Exercise Dataset
 For this project, Python was used as the primary tool for data analysis and visualization. The process began with data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas, which involved handling missing values, grouping data, and reformatting it for analysis. Visualizations were created with Matplotlib and Seaborn, enabling clear representation of trends and distributions through scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots. Statistical analysis was performed using Scipy, where techniques like Pearson correlation, ANOVA, and t-tests were applied to identify significant patterns and relationships in the data. The workflow highlighted Python's versatility in combining data manipulation, statistical testing, and visualization into a cohesive analysis process.
